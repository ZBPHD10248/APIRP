# APIRP
Here are the data and model files of a paper named 'Multi-property prediction and high-throughput screening of polyimides: an application case for interpretable machine learning'
#Code
Here is the code for calculating the difficulty of compound synthesis (SA_Scores) mentioned in the paper.
#Data
This is where all the original data for model training, testing and validation are stored in the paper. It also includes raw data from 7.6 million high-throughput screenings and data from high-performance PIs after high-throughput screening.
#Model
Here are the optimal models for the 11 properties predicted in the paper.
